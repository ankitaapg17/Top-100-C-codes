//Union in C

//Union can be defined as a user-defined data type which is a collection of different variables of 
//different data types in the same memory location. The union can also be defined as many members, 
//but only one member can contain a value at a particular point in time.
//Union is a user-defined data type, but unlike structures, they share the same memory location.


//In union, members will share the memory location.
//If we try to make changes in any of the member then it will be reflected to the other member as well

//We can save lots of space if we use unions.

//Since the double variable occupies the largest memory among all the four variables,
//so total 8 bytes will be allocated in the memory. 
//Therefore, the output of the above program would be 8 bytes.


//Enum in C

//The enum in C is also known as the enumerated type. It is a user-defined data type that consists of integer values,
//and it provides meaningful names to these values. The use of enum in C makes the program easy to understand and maintain.
//The enum is defined by using the enum keyword.

enum fruits{mango, apple, strawberry, papaya};  
//The default value of mango is 0, apple is 1, strawberry is 2, and papaya is 3. 
//If we want to change these default values, then we can do as given below:

mango=2,  
apple=1,  
strawberry=5,  
papaya=7,

#include <stdio.h>  
 enum weekdays{Sunday=1, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};

 enum weekdays w; // variable declaration of weekdays type  
 w=Monday; // assigning value of Monday to w.  
 printf("The value of w is %d",w);

#include <stdio.h>  
 enum months{jan=1, feb, march, april, may, june, july, august, september, october, november, december};

//Why do we use enum?

//The enum is used when we want our variable to have only a set of values. 
//For example, we create a direction variable. As we know that four directions exist (North, South, East, West),
//so this direction variable will have four possible values. But the variable can hold only one value at a time. 
//If we try to provide some different value to this variable, then it will throw the compilation error.


//ENUM vs Macro

//Macro can also be used to define the name constants, but in case of an enum, all the name constants can be grouped together in a single statement.
//For example,
//# define pass 0;
//# define success 1;
//
//The above two statements can be written in a single statement by using the enum type.
//enum status{pass, success};
//
//In Enum, if we do not assign the values to the enum names, then the compiler will automatically assign the default value to the enum names. But, in the case of macro, the values need to be explicitly assigned.
//The type of enum in C is an integer, but the type of macro can be of any type.




Preprocessor and Macro 

//The C preprocessor is a micro processor that is used by compiler to transform your code before compilation. It is called micro preprocessor because it allows us to add macros.
//
//Note: Proprocessor direcives are executed before compilation.
//#include
//#define

//A macro is a segment of code which is replaced by the value of macro. Macro is defined by #define directive. There are two types of macros:

//Object-like Macros:  #define PI 3.14  
//Function-like Macros
